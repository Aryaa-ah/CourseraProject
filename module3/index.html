      <h1>Chicken</h1>
      <p>
        Known for its feather and wings and legs,
The chicken lays eggs and eggs and eggs!
Known for the comb atop its crown,
The chicken lays eggs of white and brown.
Known for its strut when taking a walk,
The chicken lays eggs! Ba-a-awk! Ba-a-awk!Said the first little chicken,
With a strange little squirm,
"I wish I could find
A fat little worm."

Said the next little chicken,
With an odd little shrug:
"I wish I could find
A fat little bug."

Said a third little chicken,
With a small sigh of grief,
"I wish I could find
A green little leaf!"

Said the fourth little chicken,
With a faint little moan,
"I wish I could find
A wee gravel stone."

"Now, see here!" said the mother,
From the green garden patch,
"If you want any breakfast,
Just come here and scratch!"

ive little chickens by the old barn door,
One saw a beetle, and then there were four.
Four little chickens under a tree,
One saw a cricket, and then there were three.
Three little chickens looked for something new,
One saw a grasshopper, and then there were two.
Two little chickens said, "Oh what fun!"
One saw a ladybug, then there was one.
One little chicken began to run,
For he saw a katydid, then there were none!A hen can lay a big brown egg.
A hen can stand on just one leg.
A hen can run.
A hen can walk.
A hen can say "Bawk, bawk, bawk".
But do you know what a hen can't do?Peck, peck, peck
On the warm, brown egg.
Out comes a neck
Out comes a leg.

How does a chick,
Who's not been about,
Discover the trick
Of how to get out?

Aileen FisherOh, I am a chickie who lives in an egg.
but I will not hatch, I will not hatch.
The hens they all cackle, the roosters all beg,
But I will not hatch, I will not hatch.
For I hear all the talk of pollution and more
As the people all shout and the airplanes roar.
So I'm staying in here
where it's safe
and it's warm.
And
I WILL NOT HATCH!

Shel SilversteinThis little chick ate corn today,
This little chick ate worms they say,
This little chick ate yellow meal,
This little chick ate potato peel,
This little chick like a fluffy ball,
Ate a teeny tiny bit of all!
Corn today! Worms they say! Yellow meal! Potato peel!

          When the pineapple leaves the sea it is very wet. This is because it often falls in all of the waves whilst surfing. Suffice to say a sugar cube is a froth on a beach in a sea pond. But the currents change and charts chime a changeling tune to all of the lobsters who listen with headphones in a shell castle beneath the seat of sway.

Daring to waltz with a caterpillar today? Such a daring feat really. Little legs moving simultaneously grooving in a ground of mosquito moan. This is not a sense in a sentence and neither is it a sentence that screams a lullaby or a nursery rhyme. It is best to remain seated whilst standing upsidedown. And obviously the mentioned caterpillar waltzing can be carried out with ease in a fragrant air of lily pad loft.

Ponds are not being a path they are being a part of a pantomime with the leek and ham sandwich providing the lead role by skiing across the watery surface on a coracle made from an unused nut boat. It is believed that the water snails can fire torpedos and the pantomime suggests this by the addition of the submarine snail scene which is the one after the koi sing.

Pajamas on prawns? Yes they are all going to bed in the seaweed cliff. No dreaming of octagonal octopi with huge teeth that gleam. For that is a fable in a crab book for baby seahorses. Instead the swell is sweeping the floors of the clam castle.

In the meantime a large amount of beans are balancing on a broom of blossom whilst baking a large pie of ice cream in a bowl of molten lava.Chicken gravy. Yum. Yum. Yum.
The lightest yellow, warm on my gum.
Beef gravy – too gray for me.
Especially now, I say with a sigh.

But beef is the favorite of your dad,
He works hard, it makes him glad.
Chicken gravy is a bit of a fad.
Try beef at least. It is not too bad.

Beef gravy! Wow! Who knew?
It’s delicious, this odd gray goo!
Chicken gravy now takes a backseat.
Beef gravy is an excellent cold weather treat!

        Their names are:
Katie, Bobo, Bear--
Max and Buddy,
Sushi and
Grafin Hegwig von Stubenrein*,
Hedy for short.

For 30 years, dachshunds, chihuahuas
and miniature schnauzers.

Chihuahuas are definitely
the undercover dogs,
but dachshunds will burrow too.

Hedy and Buddy at the foot
of the bed, cross- and lengthwise.
Bobo too, but anywise.

Sushi and Max like it
when we sleep on our sides--
preferring the crooks of the knees.

Katie was an armpit dog.

Dogs are mobile and in a pinch
do double duty as a heating pad--
but a cold nose on bare skin
is welcome in the heat of the summer.

Night or nap, the company is welcome--
Did we rescue them or did they rescue us?Sometimes you wake up and your plans for the week have burned down.
You find the owners of the buildings got into a fistfight,
blaming each other for its destruction and were arrested.
I guess that means we can check it off the list of things to say goodbye to.
Time to renegotiate and go for something like that hole in the wall pizza joint with all the awards on the wall.
Time to kayak on the only part of the LA River that isn't concrete
Search it up type it in
See where it from cover the VIN
Then they think it legit
From Japan
I will and I can
Make them think
Watch me and see
I stand here dazzled and confused
I be wondering what I can choose
So many choices all in a row
On the table what do I know
One right here, one right there
Another one there, flyin' in the air
On the wall are words
But I can't read that, where are the nerds
Can I get that translated?
Can my mom just make it?
I can't be doing that
I am so confused
I speak English
I only eat your food
Can I get a menu
With English on it too?
I love what you eat
And I love that you can read
But I can't read symbols
They're only there to see
I read letters that make up words
Even though I got symbols on my shirt
Even on my car, all over to see
But just know that I cannot read
They are there for looks
And online is all it took
Search it up type it in
See where it from cover the VIN
Then they think it legit
From Japan
I will and I can
Make them think
Watch me and see TOMORROW – there will be a girl who is not you.
I’m taking her out to dinner with a friend,
(who used to be your friend, but you ignored them until they had better sense to do the same)
(but not me, never me, until I was dragging myself through glass to talk to you)
and we’re going to get sushi.
This new girl and I are going to have fun.
She reminds me of you, but don’t think of her as a replacement. Where you were ice, she is fire and warmth. A reminder of what we had that was good, without the
(thorns)
problems that came later on.
But, through the smiles and laughter and gorging on
(happiness)
raw fish, you’re still going to show up. The uninvited
(ghost)
guest.

You will be sitting with us.
In the car.
At our table.
Walking behind us in the cool, crisp evening.
You will be in all the spaces
(cracks)
in between.
You
Will
Be
Stealing
(gleefully)
My
Air.

(Only if I let you, though)
I will deal with you, however. You are there by my
(grace)
permission only. Not to scorn me, but so that I can show you.
Everything that could have been.
(I saw your light)
(Why didn’t you see mine?)
You are not the epitaph on my life. You are not where my love goes to die.
I will move on.
(And carry you gently with me)
